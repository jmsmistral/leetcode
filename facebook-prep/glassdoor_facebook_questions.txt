1. Interval ranges
    - Given two interval ranges write a function that tells me if these two ranges intersect
    - Given two interval ranges that intersect, now write a function that merges the two ranges into a continuous range
    - Write a function that takes a group of unsorted, unorganized intervals, merge any intervals that intersect and sort them. The result should be a group of sorted, non-intersecting intervals.
    - Write a function that merges a new interval into the group of non-intersecting intervals. After the merge, the group must remain non-intersecting.
2. How to get out from a maze
3. You are given a vector with the heights of an island (at point A, point B, ...), and you want to know how much water would remain in this island without flowing away.
4. [DONE] Write a function that takes a list of words and returns a list of those words, grouped into lists of anagrams.
